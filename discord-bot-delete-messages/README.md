# Discord Bot
This is a demo project of a discord bot which I have linked to a Test Server. If you type any string that isn't "hello" into the text channel the bot should delete the message.

## Dependencies
```
Mac/Linux:
    $ python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
Windows
    $ py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```

## Start the program

```
python ./main.py
```
