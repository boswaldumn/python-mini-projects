# Discord Bot
This is a demo project of a discord bot which I have linked to Test Server. If you type a string that begins with "hello" into the text channel the bot should reply with the message, "Hello, I am a big fan of fleetwood mac".

## Dependencies
```
Mac/Linux:
    $ python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
Windows
    $ py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```

## Start the program

```
python ./main.py
```
