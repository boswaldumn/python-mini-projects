# Discord Bot
This is a demo project of multiple discord bots that I have linked to a Test Server in Discord. 

## fleetwood-mac-bot.py
If you type a string that begins with "hello" into the text channel the bot should reply with the message, "Hello, I am a big fan of fleetwood mac".

## delete-messages.py
If you type any string that isn't "hello" into the text channel the bot should delete the message.
